## Abstract
Anthropogenic heat (AH) from buildings can increase urban temperature and
contribute to the urban heat island effect. The increased urban temperature
leads to more cooling demands in buildings during summer thus more
air-conditioning energy use and higher associated waste heat to the urban
environment, forming a positive feedback loop. This paper presents a dataset of
AH from buildings in Los Angeles (LA) County. The dataset is created with the
physics-based EnergyPlus building energy models to calculate individual
buildings’ AH considering WRF-UCM simulated microclimate conditions. The dataset
contains 8760 hourly AH in 2018 from buildings aggregated at three spatial
resolutions of 450m x 450m grid, 12km x 12km grid, and census tract for the
entire LA County. The AH is broken down into three components: building envelope
surface convection, heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) system heat
release, and zone exfiltration and exhaust air heat loss. The high-resolution AH
dataset can be used for research on building AH and its interaction with urban
microclimate, as well as informing effective AH reduction policy interventions
across LA County.

## Reproduce the data set

The following is an overview of the workflow

![workflow](figures/workflow.png)

Following the steps to reproduce the analysis

1. Compile a LA county geojson file with building footprint, type, vintage,
   number of stories, and footprint area using the geometry and assessor data
   files from the Dropbox folder "City Data/LA".
2. Acquire WRF climate data (in a 12 km x 12 km grid system)
3. Convert the WRF climate data of the historic forcing to epw. 
    1. Untar the "M02_EnergyPlus_Forcing_Historical_LowRes*" folder. This
       creates a folder <A> to hold all the files from the tar ball
    2. Run 0_mv_inputs.py to create folder structure and move files to
       corresponding folders. "forcing_folder" is set to be where the WRF data
       is extracted, i.e. <A> from above.
    3. Copy the "USA_CA_Los.Angeles.Intl.AP.722950_TMY3.epw" into folder <A>
    4. Run 2_wrf_to_epw.py to before this line. Note that the WRF_FOLDER at the
    beginning should be set to <A> as well. df_wrf_data =
    pd.read_csv(os.path.join(WRF_FOLDER, 'time_series', 'LA-SOLAR.csv'),
    sep=',', encoding='UTF-8')
    5. Get solar radiation input with get_solar_input.R. This creates a file
       "LA-SWDOWN_input_to_excel.csv" in the <a>/time_series folder. The file
       looks like this
    6. Open the file and copy data to the excel tool Los_Angeles_TMY_2010s Solar
     irradiance.xlsx. Note that for leap year, we should not copy in the Feb 29
     data, as the excel tool won't accept that. Also due to UTC to local time
     conversion, there is a time shift, the UTC time 2018 does not cover the
     whole local time 2018. We’ll use the year-end data of the previous year to
     fill in for the missing hours of the current end of year. Then paste the W,
     X, Y column in sheet "Output – Isotropic sky" to
     "LA-SWDOWN_input_to_excel.csv". For Feb 29 data, paste it in the "input"
     sheet in place of Feb 28, then get the output three solar component of Feb
     28 from "Output – Isotropic sky", and paste them in the Feb 29 slots in the
     csv. Change the column names of the three solar component to "sw_normal",
     "sw_dif", and "sw_dir". Save the csv file as LA-SOLAR.csv
    7. Go back to 2_wrf_to_epw.py, now the previous line should run through and
       read in solar data to df_wrf_data.
    8. Check whether there are missing data in the generated .epw files using
       check_epw_err.R. Missing values are most often in Dew Point. If there are
       missing values, use fill_na_in_epw.R to fill the missing value with the
       previous non-missing record.
4. Assign the nearest grid point to each building. The epw files for the
   assigned grid point will be used in the simulation of the target building.
   This is documented in the rmd/1_match_building_to_grid.Rmd file
5. For each building type-vintage combination in each grid cell, simulate the
   historic forcing. There are xx possible prototype buildings and 3 possible
   vintages, but we will only simulate the type-vintage combination appearing in
   each grid cell (see xx for the mapping from grid cells to type-vintage
   combination). Use "3_write_baseline_idf.py" adapted from
   [im3 repo from Xuan](https://github.com/LBNL-ETA/im3-wrf/blob/main/3_write_baseline_idf.ipynb) to
   create EnergyPlus models.
7. Adjust prototype models
    - Change the design condition, using 3_idf_preprocess.R. The script first
      copies the idf files from input_data/annual_WRF into
      intermediate_data/idf_to_modify, then change the design day and location
      of the idf files then output them to
      intermediate_data/idf_change_design_day
    - Add run period and output variables using 3_write_baseline_idf.py: takes
      idf from intermediate_data/idf_change_design_day and add runperiod and
      output variables, outputs to intermediate_data/idf_add_sim_period_output
    - Remove un-used dependencies from files: 3_replace_schedule_csv_path.R
    - Create heavy and light manufacturing facility models by adjusting the
      electric and gas equipment to match the EUI of the MECS 75th and 25th
      percentile
        - retrieve the 25th and 75th percentile using get_manufacturing_energy_stats.R
        - adjust the model electricity and gas equipment using 3_get_manufacturing_idf.R
    - Update model version using idfVersionUpdater.exe
    - fix errors in the Religious model by running 3_fix_religious.R. The
      original model have some errors of missing objects and wrong value for the
      start day in the RunPeriod object.
    - fix a field in nursing home model using 3_correct_nursingHome.R
    - change the year and "Day of Week for Start Day" in the RunPeriod object to
      match the actual simulation year
8. Use run_sim.py to run simulations:
   - evaluate run_multi_thread(k) function with the desired number of thread to
     run the simulation combinations specified in "df" at the beginning read
     from intermediate_data/epw_idf_to_simulate.csv.
   - use test_run_all_model() to simulate all idf files in the same folder using
     a certain .epw file. This function is used in generating the simulation
     result in the verification against ResStock ComStock, and various
     scorecards
9. Validation with measured and other data source
    - county level: see details in verify_county.R
    - county neighborhood: verify against Energy Atlas neighborhood data in 2016.
     See details in verify_county.R
    - verify with ResStock and ComStock data for LA county. See details in
      verify_resstock_comstock.R.
    - verify with PNNL prototype model and NREL reference model scorecards. See
      details in verify_scorecards.R
10. Produce grid-level heat emission data. The hourly grid-level or census tract
    level heat and energy data is compiled in aggregate_to_grid.R, by running
    compile.grid.data() for certain grid level (or census tract) and year.
11. Produce building metadata geojson: use join_building_to_tract_finer_grid.R

## Comparison of 2018 and 2016 results
2016 results is also available for hourly AH and energy consumption. Comparing
with the 2018 results, the county total AH is 1.2% lower and energy consumption
is 0.3% higher, with an annual average dry bulb temperature difference of
0.03°C. Monthly difference between the two years are more substential, with as
high as 32% difference in AH in January with a 3.3°C difference in average dry
bulb temperature.

The following figure plots the average monthly dry bulb temperature, relative
humidity, and wind speed. 2018 has hotter weather from July to September and in
January. 2018 is colder in February and March.

![cmp_2016_2018_weather](figures/cmp_2016_2018_weather.png)

This figure compares the total heat emission and energy consumption for the
whole county. We can see the heat emission between the two years is pretty
similar. Energy consumption differs a bit more. The difference generally follows
the temperature trend.

![cmp_2016_2018_county_total](figures/cmp_2016_2018_county_total.png)

The following figure shows the AH without the surface component. The AH from
non-envelope components is more pronounced between the two years and still
follows the temperature trend.

![cmp_2016_2018_county_total_no_surf](figures/cmp_2016_2018_county_total_no_surf.png)
